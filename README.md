## Project Overview

GigFlow is a full-stack freelance marketplace application where clients can post gigs and freelancers can place bids on them. The gig owner can review all received bids and hire exactly one freelancer for a gig. Once a freelancer is hired, all other bids are automatically rejected to maintain consistency.

The application focuses on implementing real-world backend logic such as secure authentication, role-based access control, transactional hiring workflows, and real-time notifications. It also demonstrates how modern full-stack applications handle cross-user interactions and state updates in production environments.

GigFlow is designed as a learning-focused project that reflects real product workflows commonly found in freelance platforms, while keeping the architecture clean, scalable, and easy to reason about.
